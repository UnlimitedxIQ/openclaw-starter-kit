- Executed Amendment T Day 2 + Day 3 planning and produced a full asset pack in `amendment-t/`.
- Chosen fast-first-dollar offer: “Weekly Executive KPI Report + Ops Automation” for SMBs; ToS-compliant, manual-first then automate.
- Bryson preference: default to doing things autonomously whenever possible; only ask when required (especially external actions / sensitive / destructive).
- Added Bryson contact: +15037075818. Bryson asked for a daily 9:00 AM (America/Los_Angeles) check-in call where Noble asks a few questions; scheduled cron reminder.
