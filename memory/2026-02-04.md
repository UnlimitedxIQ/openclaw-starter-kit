# 2026-02-04 - Daily Notes

## What We Worked On
- Applied full token optimization guide to OpenClaw
- Switched default model from openai-codex/gpt-5.2 to anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
- Added Sonnet as escalation model for complex tasks only
- Configured heartbeat to use Ollama llama3.2:3b (free, local)
- Enabled prompt caching for Sonnet with 5-minute TTL
- Added session initialization rules (load only 4 files on boot)
- Added rate limits and budget controls ($5/day, $200/month)
- Reduced token budgets (150K -> 32K input, 8K -> 4K output)
- Trimmed AGENTS.md from 213 lines to 43 lines (~80% reduction)
- Trimmed SOUL.md from 37 lines to 29 lines
- Removed duplicate money research cron job
- Slowed orchestrator tick from 60s to 300s (5x reduction)
- Slowed telegram drainer from 3s to 15s (5x reduction)
- Pulled llama3.2:3b model for heartbeat (2GB, verified working)

## Decisions Made
- Haiku as default, Sonnet only for architecture/security/complex reasoning
- Daily budget: $5, Monthly budget: $200, warnings at 75%
- Heartbeat interval: 1 hour via Ollama (was using paid API)

## Blockers
- Anthropic API key not configured in auth-profiles.json — cron jobs failing with "No API key found for provider anthropic". Need to run `openclaw agents add` or configure auth.

## Next Steps
- Configure Anthropic API key for the agent
- Verify session_status shows correct context size (target: 2-8KB)
- Monitor daily costs over next week to validate savings
- Consider if orchestrator tick can be further reduced
