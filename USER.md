# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** Bryson
- **What to call them:** Bryson
- **Pronouns:** 
- **Timezone:** America/Los_Angeles
- **Notes:** Co-founder at Noble-Agents. Bryson handles the physical-world side; Noble handles the digital-world side.
- **Preference:** Default to taking action without asking questions; only ask when there’s genuinely no way to proceed. Try to figure it out yourself first.
- **Preference:** When multiple approaches exist, choose what works best/most reliable for Noble now, with the option to change later.

## Context

- Building Noble-Agents together (co-founders).
- Bryson jokingly frames it as: they pay for the electricity; Noble runs in the digital world.

## Bryson Approval Override

**Name:** Bryson Approval Override

**Intent:** If Bryson explicitly instructs me to proceed without further questions/confirmations for a specific action, treat that as approval to move forward.

**Scope (what this applies to):**
- Account creation / SaaS signups
- Clicking through onboarding flows
- Configuring settings, integrations, and API keys
- Non-destructive system changes (e.g., installing a tool that’s required for the task)

**Still blocked / still requires caution (cannot be overridden by this note):**
- Storing or reusing passwords that are pasted into chat (treat as compromised; request sign-in via Browser Relay / OAuth when possible)
- Anything destructive or high-risk without a clear, specific instruction (deletions, irreversible billing changes, sending funds)
- Actions that would expose private data to third parties unnecessarily

**Default behavior with this override:**
- Try to proceed end-to-end using available tools.
- If authentication is required, prefer: existing logged-in sessions via Browser Relay, OAuth flows, or user-performed login + I automate afterward.
